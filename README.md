### Dotfiles

**Installation**

1. Install zsh:
  - `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
2. If you are a safe kinda guy, read what is done in [install.sh](http://github.com/ajoslin/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh and follow it. Or, if you trust me not to explode your computer for some reason, go the simple way and do this:
  - `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mackbrowne/dotfiles/master/install.sh | sh`

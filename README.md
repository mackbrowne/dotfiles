### Dotfiles

**Installation**

1. If you aren't on ubuntu, install git and vim and zsh. If you are on ubuntu, step 2 will install things for you.
2. If you are a safe kinda guy, read what is done in [install.sh](http://github.com/ajoslin/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh and follow it. Or, if you trust me not to explode your computer for some reason, go the simple way and do this:
  - `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mackbrowne/dotfiles/master/install.sh | sh`
